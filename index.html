    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <b>Effective Date: 25/12/2025</b><br><br>

    At <b>CitiFix</b>, your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect,
    why we collect it, and how it is used within the app. By using CitiFix, you agree to the practices
    described below.

    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
      We collect only the information required to enable civic issue reporting and tracking:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Name & Email:</b> Used for account creation, authentication, and complaint association.</li>
        <li><b>Phone Number (Optional):</b> Collected only if you choose to provide it.</li>
        <li><b>City / Locality:</b> Helps route complaints to the appropriate civic authority.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>2. Complaint Information</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
      When you report a civic issue, the following information may be collected:
      <ul>
        <li>Issue category and description</li>
        <li>Photos uploaded or captured as evidence</li>
        <li>Location of the reported issue (issue location, not your home address)</li>
        <li>Date and time of submission</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>3. Voice Input (Optional)</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
      CitiFix offers an optional speech-to-text feature to make complaint reporting faster.
      <br><br>
      <b>Important:</b> Voice input is used only to convert speech into text.
      Audio is not recorded, stored, or shared.
    </div>

    <h3>4. How We Use Your Data</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
      The collected data is used solely to:
      <ul>
        <li>Enable citizens to report civic issues</li>
        <li>Attach accurate location details to reported issues</li>
        <li>Route complaints to relevant civic authorities</li>
        <li>Display complaint status and authority responses</li>
        <li>Allow escalation or validation of unresolved issues</li>
        <li>Generate anonymized analytics and insights</li>
      </ul>
      CitiFix does <b>not</b> use personal data for advertising or marketing.
    </div>

    <h3>5. Use of Device Features</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
      CitiFix may access certain device features strictly for app functionality:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Internet:</b> To communicate with servers, Firebase services, and fetch updates.</li>
        <li><b>Location:</b> To tag reported civic issues with accurate issue locations.</li>
        <li><b>Photos & Storage:</b> To allow users to upload or capture images as complaint evidence.</li>
        <li><b>Microphone:</b> Only if the user chooses to use voice-to-text while reporting an issue.</li>
      </ul>
      All access is user-initiated, purpose-limited, and never continuous.
    </div>

    <h3>6. Email-Based Complaint Routing</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
      CitiFix uses an email-based system to forward civic complaints to the appropriate authorities.
      <br><br>
      When a complaint is submitted:
      <ul>
        <li>The app requests permission <b>only to send emails</b> from the user’s email account.</li>
        <li>A secure access token is transmitted to the CitiFix server.</li>
        <li>The server sends the complaint email on the user’s behalf.</li>
        <li>CitiFix’s official email account is included in CC for tracking purposes.</li>
      </ul>
      CitiFix <b>does not read or access the user’s email inbox</b>.
      <br><br>
      Authority responses are retrieved only from CitiFix’s own email account and displayed
      inside the app to maintain transparency and complaint tracking.
    </div>

    <h3>7. Data Storage & Security</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
      We use <b>Firebase Authentication</b> for secure login and identity management.
      <br><br>
      <b>Firebase Firestore</b> stores:
      <ul>
        <li>User profile information</li>
        <li>Complaint details and status updates</li>
      </ul>
      Uploaded images are securely stored in <b>Firebase Cloud Storage</b>.
    </div>

    <h3>8. Data Sharing</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
      CitiFix does <b>not</b> sell, rent, or trade personal data.
      <br><br>
      Complaint details are shared only with relevant civic authorities for the purpose
      of issue resolution.
    </div>

    <h3>9. Public Visibility of Complaints</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
      Reported civic issues may appear in a public feed within the app to improve visibility
      and enable community engagement such as upvotes.
      <br><br>
      Personal contact details and user identities are never displayed publicly.
    </div>

    <h3>10. Data Retention After Account Deletion</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
      When a user requests account deletion:
      <ul>
        <li>All personally identifiable information (name, email, phone number, and user ID) is permanently deleted.</li>
        <li>The user account is removed from Firebase Authentication.</li>
        <li>Civic issues reported by the user may be retained in an anonymized form for transparency,
            analytics, and public accountability.</li>
        <li>All personal identifiers are removed, and retained issue data is no longer linked to a user.</li>
        <li>Location data retained represents only the location of the reported issue, not the user.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h3>11. Children’s Privacy</h3>
    <div style="margin-left: 20px;">
      CitiFix is intended for users aged 13 and above.
